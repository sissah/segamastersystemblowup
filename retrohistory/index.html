        <p>Originally released as the Sega Mark III to the Japanese market in 1985,
          the Sega Master System was Sega's answer to the juggernaut that was the
          Nintendo Entertainment System. Despite failing to topple Nintendo's iron grip
          on the market in Japan and the United States, the Sega Master System did
          prove Sega's ability to compete in international markets, such as Brazil
          and Europe.</p>

            Hawaii based coin-op company Sega Corporation and import company Rosen
            Enterprises) was mainly in the business of producing arcade games.
            However, as the arcade world began to dwindle in popularity, the
            company shifted attention to home gaming consoles, as per the advice
            given by the Hayao Nakayama, president of Sega at the time. </p>

            was already a technically good system for its time, and was able to
            enjoy most of its success in Europe from 1987 to 1996 after taking
            the opportunity to reach towards the European market after seeing
            that Nintendo has been neglecting that particular region. Nintendo’s
            marketing was not able to capture the general audience in Europe at
            the release of the NES in the mid-80s due to improper market management.</p>

            of the market in North America and Japan, the Sega Master System
            found greater success in the European and Brazilian markets. Even
            so, the dominance of Nintendo and with Sega as a distant runner up
            in the wake of Atari’s downfall, marked a shift away from an industry
            led by American game companies towards Japanese game companies.
            However, with greater marketing, a lower cost than Nintendo’s
            console, and a larger collection of games than were released in North
            America, the Sega Master System was the popular system of the time in Europe,
            selling nearly 1.75 million consoles in 1991 alone (Sega Retro).</p>
